</aside>

</section>
<section id="plan-bell" class="slide level1">
<h1>plan bell</h1>
<aside class="notes">
“You will all agree,” said he, “that our chief danger consists in the sly and treacherous manner in which the enemy approaches us. Now, if we could receive some signal of the Cat’s approach, we could easily escape from it. I venture, therefore, to propose that a small bell be procured, and attached by a ribbon around the neck of the Cat. By this means we should always know when the Cat was about, and could easily escape while the Cat was in the neighbourhood.”

</aside>

# lives
<aside class="notes">
After the lives of so many Mice, family members and friends, were taken away by the Cat, 
</aside>

# meeting
<aside class="notes">
the Mice decided to hold a meeting, behind closed doors, in a nice private and hidden location, while the cat slept
</aside>

# debate
<aside class="notes">
where they considered and debated what they should do to stop this onslaught of violence and danger to their lives from the dreaded Cat.
</aside>

# plans
<aside class="notes">
Many plans were discussed. One mice asked, “Remember our cousin Tuffy from the West? He tamed that old cat on the farm. Or I at least heard that in the cheese bar. We can get him to do the same for us!”
</aside>

# tuffy
<aside class="notes">
The council of mice rejoiced at the idea, but another mouse spoke up and said “Oh, that was a long time ago. 
</aside>

# control
<aside class="notes">
Tuffy really lost control of himself. He died of a cheese overdose.”
</aside>

# disguise
<aside class="notes">
Another mouse proposed that they all disguise themselves as cats because surely the Cat wouldn’t eat another cat. 
</aside>

# bad idea
<aside class="notes">
The council of mice did not like this plan. 
</aside>
The council of mice did not like this plan. 

# move

Another mouse proposed they all move. 
</aside>

# bad idea 2
<aside class="notes">
The council did not like this plan either 
</aside>
# Dr. nibble cheese
<aside class="notes">
But then, at last, a Dr. Nibble-cheese, a mouse well respected in the Mice community,  rose up in front of the council and said he had a proposal to make, which he thought would meet the case. 
</aside>

# plan bell
<aside class="notes">
“You will all agree,” said he, “that our chief danger consists in the sly and treacherous manner in which the enemy approaches us. 
Now, if we could receive some signal of the Cat’s approach, we could easily escape from it. I venture, therefore, to propose that a small bell be procured, and attached by a ribbon around the neck of the Cat. By this means we should always know when the Cat was about, and could easily escape while the Cat was in the neighbourhood.”
</aside>

# good idea
<aside class="notes">
This proposal was welcomed with applause, 
</aside>

# party time
<aside class="notes">
celebration, and general sounds of merriment (picture of mice partying sound of applause) But as the merriment died down
</aside>

# elder mouse
<aside class="notes">
an elder mouse stood up, taking center stage in front of the council of Mice and said: “I agree with you all that the plan before us is all very well, but who is going to place the bell on the Cat?”
</aside>

# who will bell the cat?
<aside class="notes">
The mice looked at one another and nobody spoke. (Picture of mice sound of crickets chirping)
</aside>

# moral
<aside class="notes">
Then the old mouse said: “It is easy to propose impossible remedies. It is one thing to say that something should be done, but quite a different matter to do it.
